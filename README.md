# Data-From-Public-API
Description:
This project demonstrates how to fetch user data from a public API using JavaScript's Fetch API.
It requests data from the JSONPlaceholder API and displays the first 6 users on a webpage.
Each user's name, email, and address are shown in styled user cards.
A 3-column grid layout is used to neatly organize the user cards.
Error handling is implemented to catch and display network issues.
A reload button is included to re-fetch the data on demand.
The project enhances understanding of asynchronous JavaScript, APIs, and DOM manipulation.
